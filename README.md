# Your First Unit Test in Angular

## 1. Challenge #1
- First, in our `app` folder create a file called `app.component.spec.ts`.
- Based on Setup we talked earleir, letÂ´s code a basic structure of testing inside the file just created.`describe`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach`, `it` functions can be used if you think all or some are necessary.
<b>Note: </b> Do not worry about using `TestBed` and rare `imports`, it's just the structure. Piece of cake, right! :cake: :smirk:
