# Your First Unit Test in Angular

## Challenge #1

- First, in our `app` folder, create a file called `app.component.spec.ts`.
- You only need to use `describe` and `it`. 
- Make sure you read the example we previously used.
- Declare a `boolean` variable called **truly** and assign `true` to it.
- Create a `spec` to be sure the **truly** variable certainly evaluates to `true`.

**Note:** Do not worry about using `TestBed` and rare `imports`, it's just the structure. Piece of cake!, You got this! :cake: :smirk:

To ensure your snippet of code is ok, just have to run `ng test` in your terminal, if something goes wrong, the terminal will respond similar to  `Executed 1 of 1 (1 FAILED) ERROR`, otherwise the response will be similar to  `Executed 1 of 1 SUCCESS`. Also our chrome browser will shows us a success clear message.
