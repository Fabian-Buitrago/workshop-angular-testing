# Your First Unit Test in Angular

In this workshop we'll cover the most common unit test in Angular Applications, We'll learn some basics by doing testing to Components, Services and Pipes. Hope you enjoy :blush:

During whole workshop we will work on  `Workshop-ATesting` application, which very basic app about consuming a random Chuck Norris Jokes API and result is displayed on screen.

## 1. Download or clone this Repo

After downloading or cloning the app, you have to install all its dependencies running `npm install`, this process can take a couple of minutes, so.. go for some coffee and wait :coffee:

## 2. Run Application

once all depencecies've been installed, its time to run our application, simply run `ng s -o` and after seconds app will be served in `localhost:4200`
